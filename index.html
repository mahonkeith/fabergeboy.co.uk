        <h1>Welcome to Keiths page to learn about HTML/CSS</h1>
        <!--"p" is used for paragraphs to create blocks of text-->
        <p> Here I am going to write these things down to learn how to do HTML and CSS. If you have a problem with that, you have some attidue mister. The followinf are some examples of things that I have learned to do with HTML. First off, lists: </p>
        
        <h2> Lists </h2>
            <!--Example of an ordered list-->
            <h3> Ordered Lists</h3>
            <p>Ordered lists can be created that have numbering. They, like unorder lists, use the "li" or "list item" tag. For example a list of largest cities in the UK by population could read: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>London</li>
                    <li>Birmingham</li>
                    <li>Manchester</li>
                    <li>Liverpool</li>
                    <li>Leeds</li>
                </ol>
            <h3> Unordered lists</h3>
            <!--Example of an unordered list-->
            <p>Unordered lists provide the same but without an order of preference or suggested weighting. For example, a shopping list:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Milk</li>
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Eggs</li>
                    <li>Lemons</li>
                </ul>

        <h2>Breaks</h2>
            <!--use "<br/>" for a line break, does't need an opening and closing tag.-->
            <p>Breaks are used to create line breaks between text</p>
            <br/>
            <p>This should not be used for styling. Styling should be done in CSS. You can also use a "hr/" tag for a horizontal rule</p>
            <hr/>
            <!--Neither empty html tags need a trailing slash-->
        
        <h2>And something sensual.</h2>
